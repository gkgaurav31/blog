# Steps to deploy a NodeJS application on Azure App Service

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) provides a simple way to setting up a pipeline to build and deploy your applications.
There are pre-configured / templates to deploy directly to Azure App Services which makes it even easier.

__The major steps are:__  
    

- Create a new repository on GitHub and push your code. Here is a sample code which you can use:
[https://github.com/gkgaurav31/nodejs-github-actions](https://github.com/gkgaurav31/nodejs-github-actions)

- Go to your repository on GitHub and click on Actions. Create a New Workflow and search for __Deploy Node.js to Azure Web App__ 

- In the template that comes up, update the WebApp Name, NodeJS Version and the location of your application (default is root, which you should be fine for this sample app)

- Now, GitHub needs a way to get authorization to deploy the application to Azure WebApp.  
This will require a publish profile which will be set as a secret. Follow the below steps:  
    
    - Go to your WebApp's Overview blade and click on __"Publish Profile"__. Copy the contents of this Publish Profile which gets downloaded.  

    - Go to your __GitHub Repository -> Settings -> Secrets__
    
    - Create a new secret called __AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE__. Paste the content of the publish profile as the value.

- That's it! Commit the changes, which will trigger this pipeline and the application should get deployed.

__Sample YAML Configuration File__

```yml
# This workflow will build and push a node.js application to an Azure Web App on every push to the master branch.
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Set up a secret in your repository named AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE with the value of your Azure publish profile.
#
# 2. Change the values for the AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME, AZURE_WEBAPP_PACKAGE_PATH and NODE_VERSION environment variables  (below).
